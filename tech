I started my tech journey in 2024 with cloud computing. I wasn't quite serious with it because of health and family issues. This year, being 2025, I reregistered for the class and facing my fears squarely. Thanks to God for settling my health issues. I'm taking the bull by the horn this year. Currently, I'm relearning cloud computing, majoring in the 3 most popular clouds- AWS,GCP and Azure. The class includes some system administration trainings, DevOps and Cybersecurity. I'm also learning Software Engineering and I'm being coached by the Almighty Engr Adesina, whose principles,tenacit and discipline I admire so much.
